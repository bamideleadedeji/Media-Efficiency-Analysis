# Project Overview
A data-driven analysis of advertising channel effectiveness using marketing spend and sales data. 
This project identifies the most efficient media channels and provides actionable budget optimization 
recommendations.

# Business Problem
Determine which advertising channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) deliver the best results per dollar spent, 
and optimize marketing budget allocation to maximize sales impact.

# Solution Approach
Efficiency Scoring: Developed composite scores combining correlation strength and cost efficiency
Budget Optimization: Recommended optimal budget allocation based on performance metrics
Data Visualization: Created comparative charts showing cost vs effectiveness relationships

# Key Findings
TV demonstrates the strongest correlation with sales and highest efficiency score
Radio shows moderate effectiveness but better cost efficiency than newspaper
Newspaper advertising has the weakest impact and lowest efficiency
Current budget allocation shows significant optimization potential

# Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
Jupyter Notebook for analysis
Statistical correlation analysis

# Skills Demonstrated
Marketing Mix Modeling
Budget Optimization Analysis
Data-Driven Decision Making
Business Intelligence Reporting
Statistical Correlation Analysis

# Data Source
